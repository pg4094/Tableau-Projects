<h1>Tesla Stock Price Analytics</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
Tesla is an American electric vehicle and clean energy company. An important shareholder is tired of receiving only monthly updates of the stock price. The shareholder would like to see any trends of the stock price specifically for the last 3 months. He also wants this data to be updated daily.

He has given us csv files from which we have to create a Dashboard for his quick review so that he could take further decisions for the benefit of the company.

Thus, we created below interactive dashboard as per his requirement. Now, he could switch and view
different shipping stats for different months and years.
